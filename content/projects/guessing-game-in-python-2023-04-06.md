Ah, the memories...

I was but a young college freshman. One of my professors approached me and asked if I was open to working for someone outside my college classes. Well, the stupid and naive person that was, I accepted the college. But that's a story for another time.

Before I could accept the challenge, I was tasked to write a very basic Python program. 

What the hell was I supposed to write? I was very fresh in the coding world. I barely knew for loops, okay? Now, ironically, I don't even use for loops.

Anyway, I made this game. It's just a simple number-guessing game. Guess a number and the program will tell you if you're getting warmer or colder. Now, over the years, I kind of went back and fixed some things, of course.

So, [check it out](https://github.com/alexspurlock25/guessing-game) if you want. Obviously, it's nothing to win prizes about, ha!
