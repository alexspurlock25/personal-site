One of my dreams is to help people with my skills and talents. I did that here. I reached out to a friend of my mom's, and asked if they would like me to redesign their website! Let's call them Don, for privacy reasons.

They accepted.

So, using their creds to a cPanel, I logged in, navigated to the FTP, and saw a few problems. First, this particular website uses a lot of images. A lot. Next, the website wraps the content in a frame somehow and keeps the navigation menu still. Whatever was happening here, it was not mobile-friendly.

I begin by literally rehauling the website using ReactJS and TailwindCSS. The process was hard at times, but extremely easy at other times. Particularly during the times of making React components sing and shine. The images gave me the most headache, but I never turn away from a challenge.

I made sure the SSO was okay. Probably the biggest awesome thing is that accessibility was a big part of this rehaul. People with screen readers should have an easier time reading all those images! While developing, I made sure that mobile-friendliness was a core part of the rehaul. However, for the first time, I encountered something I didn't for some time as a hobbyist coder.

As I was rewriting the website from the ground up, Don, the domain owner, gave me feedback. This kind of reminded me of Agile methodology. I made a thing, and she gave feedback, and I would iterate. Anyway, she asked that I stayed true to the original design of the website. This was hard for me to accept, but I did do just that. So now, the website has a 2000s look with a modern feel.

After about two weeks, I finished the website. [You can check it out here.](http://www.elegantheirlooms.com)
